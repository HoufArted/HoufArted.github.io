# 100 Dollar Art Show

## The problem

- You, the artist own too much of your own work. It has become a storage problem in your tiny NYC apartment, and your friends and family can only accept so many paintings. You are the supply.
- Lots of people love art but can’t afford to buy paintings at gallery prices.  Lots of people would love to replace their old Bob Marley poster with a piece of original art work. They are the demand.
- There is no marketplace to connect you with all the people who want to buy your art. Let’s connect this supply with this demand in the 100 Dollar Art Show!

## The solution
               
- One night only Art Show!
- 10 artists sell 10 art works each
- Each art work is on sale for 100 dollars
- Artists keep 100% of sales​

- Non-profit artist’s organization
- Spring 2019
